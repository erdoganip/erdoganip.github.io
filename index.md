### Pattern Recognition
[Expectation Maximization](/expectation_maximization)
<br/>
In this project, I implemented Expectation Maximization algorithm as a solution to cluster a dataset which is a Gaussian Mixture model, includes three different Gaussian distribution.

### Deep Learning

[MLP as a Neural Language Model](/mlp_language)
<br/>
In this project, I implemented a neural language model using a multi-layer perceptron. This network receives 3 consecutive words as the input and predicts the next word.
